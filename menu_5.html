Proposal #1
The first proposal for sssthe final project I want to choose the Museum of Natural History. I want to more specifically focus on the Ross Center for Earth and Space. Preferably I would like the section and gallery to be renovated and have a temporary gallery containing an Air and Space theme. I derived the idea from in the Smithsonian with its National Air and Space Museum down in Washington D.C. As there is a lack of aviation and spacecraft type of Museums or the like within New York City, I thought it would be insightful to have it be shown in the Museum of Natural History.  The gallery will address the understanding and the knowledge of aviation and space crafts and the progress within the United States and how for they have come since the beginning air flight. This exhibition will be an inclusive history and a sensory exhibit.

Proposal #2
My next proposal will be located at The Met. Once again a temporary gallery,  it will be a fashion exhibit just like the Comme Des Garcon exhibit designed by the brands designer Rei Kawakubo. The gallery will be led and designed by Virgil Abloh, the creator of Off-White. Within the last year Off-White has taken over the design world, with its simple look and style of street wear as well as the way his collaborations with many brands and re designing the clothing and shoes in his their own unique Off White style. His clothing and brand is recognizable universally with the words in the font Helvetica within the quotation marks. The gallery will contain art as well as clothing designed as a collab with The Met all made by Virgil. The theme of the address gun violence, as it seems to be a major discussion of topic as of recent. And of course the gallery will solely be an art gallery, where all the pieces of art and clothing will be auctioned off and all the money will go to a cause.
